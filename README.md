## ⭐ STAR Methodology Breakdown

### 🔹 Situation
Electric vehicles (EVs) are transforming the transportation industry, driven by sustainability goals and technological advancements. Understanding where, how, and which types of EVs are gaining traction is key for industry stakeholders and policymakers.

### 🔹 Task
Design a **comprehensive Power BI dashboard** using real-world EV registration data that:
- Tracks growth patterns and model-year trends
- Highlights manufacturer and model dominance
- Assesses Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility
- Compares BEVs vs PHEVs by city, state, and utility

### 🔹 Action

#### ✅ Data Preprocessing
- Loaded data into **Power Query**
- Removed irrelevant columns
- Validated column quality (nulls, errors, duplicates)

#### 📐 Dashboard KPIs & Charts

| 📊 Metric | 💡 Value / Description |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Total Vehicles** | 150.42K |
| **Average Electric Range** | 67.83 Km |
| **BEV Vehicles** | 117K (78% of total) |
| **PHEV Vehicles** | 34K (22% of total) |
| **CAFV Eligibility** | Eligible: 63K, Not Eligible: 70K, Unknown: 18K |

#### 📊 Key Visualizations

| Chart | Type | Insight |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Total Vehicles by Model Year** | Line Chart | Growth trend (2012–2024), spike at 2023 with 37K vehicles |
| **Total Vehicles by State** | Map | Geographic spread, highest concentration in coastal states |
| **Top 10 Vehicles by Make** | Bar Chart | Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford leading |
| **Top 10 Vehicles by Model** | Treemap | Includes Model Y, Model 3, LEAF, Bolt EV, etc. |
| **CAFV Eligibility Breakdown** | Donut Chart | Impact of fuel policy incentives |
| **Interactive Filters** | Slicers | By City, Electric Utility, Vehicle Type (BEV/PHEV) |

### 🔹 Result
The resulting dashboard allows for:
- Quick insights into **EV growth** across years and states
- Understanding of **manufacturer dominance**
- Evaluation of **policy effectiveness** via CAFV eligibility
- Data-driven strategy formation for infrastructure, sales, and R&D
