## 🎯 Problem Statement
With the rapid increase in electric vehicle adoption, analyzing trends based on model year, manufacturer, eligibility, and vehicle type becomes crucial for policymakers, industry analysts, and sustainability researchers.

This dashboard aims to:
- Visualize the growth of EV registrations over time
- Analyze the distribution by **vehicle make**, **model**, and **state**
- Compare BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles) and PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles)
- Understand eligibility based on Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) standards
